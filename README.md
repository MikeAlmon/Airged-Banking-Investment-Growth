# Airged-Banking-Investment-Growth
Southern New Hampshire University CS210 Programming Languages Class Project

**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.**  
	Airged Banking, one of Chada Tech's clients, wants a program that will allow users
	to simulate investment growth opportunities, compounded monthly. The user will be able to
	enter an initial monthly investment, a monthly deposit, an interest rate, and number of
	years until maturity. The program will then display comparative results for balance and
	interest with no monthly deposit versus balance and interest with a monthly deposit.
	
**What did you do particularly well?**  
		I believe I made effective use of classes. I was able to develop this program with two functions in my main.cpp file. The bulk of the work was done in the Investment.cpp and Investment.h files.
		
**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on**  
**Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?**  
	One area I need to work on is input validation. It was frustrating trying to catch invalid input, such as a character being input instead of a number. I believe more practice with try, throw, and catch methods will help.
	
**What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**  
	Learning how to develop and utilize classes has been a good exercise. I am currently trying to utilize them to create different objects for my work with inventory and quality at my job. I am hoping to develop new applications to help alleviate some of the tasks that can be automated, such as reading files.
	
**How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**  
	Using classes has a couple of benefits, including reducing coding in the main part of the project and creating a modular process. Have a modular process allows each part to be developed and tested individually first before being introduced to other objects. During testing, it also helps to identify where bugs or logic errors are easier.
